Liquid Wars for the Android OS (2.3 and above).
Copyright (C) 2013 Henry Shepperd (hshepperd@gmail.com)

Liquid Wars is a complete rewrite and redesign of the original
game "Liquid War" (http://www.ufoot.org/liquidwar/), but has
been designed for the Android operating system.

On Linux machines (and probably most other Unix based machines) the
build.sh, install.sh and run.sh shell scripts should build, install
and run on a debug device, provided the Android SDK, NDK and adb are
set up correctly.
